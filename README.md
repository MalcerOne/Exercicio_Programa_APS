# BlackJack game made in Python3!


As an introduction to Python, we had to program a BlackJack game from the beggining, including CPU interaction as a player and a dealer of the cards.

The game includes all except errors that could possibly go wrong when you are typing at the terminal, like writing numbers instead of words in a certain input.

Feel free to play!
